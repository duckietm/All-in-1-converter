Download all the required assets

```cmd
clothes
download furnidata 
download productdata
download furniture
download variables
download texts
download icons
```
This will download all that is required.

# Step 2
run the "c:\Tools\run.bat" this will confurt all the SWF / Config files to .nitro and .json for the config.

We already place the default and extra effects in "C:\Tools\asset_default" so this will be done automaticly.

When done all the files will be in : C:\tools\Convert\assets

And that's it you are ready to Rock !
